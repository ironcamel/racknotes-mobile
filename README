INSTALLATION
------------

You should first install the dependencies:

    sudo cpan Crypt::Simple Dancer JSON JSON::XS List::UtilsBy LWP Plack Template YAML

DEPLOYMENT
----------

The easiest way to deploy is:

    ./bin/app.pl

That will run the app with a simple, blocking web server. It is fine for
development, but you will want to use a real web server when running live.
I prefer something like Starman or Twiggy. For example, to deploy with
Twiggy, first install it:

    sudo cpan Twiggy

And then run it:

    plackup -s Twiggy -l ./bin/app.pl

See http://p3rl.org/Dancer::Deployment to see more deployment options, such
as Apache, nginx, lighttpd, etc.
